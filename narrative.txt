The digipet game is based on visiting specific endpoints to keep your digipet healthy and happy.
If you do not have a digipet yet and you try to visit "/digipet/walk" for example,
you will be prompted to first hatch your digipet before you can start treating it like a pet. 



New digipet spec 

1.GIVEN that the user does not have a digipet, WHEN they send a GET request to the /digipet/hatchnew endpoint, 
THEN the server responds with a message informing them that they don't have a digipet and suggesting that they try hatching 
one first before hatching a second digipet.

2.GIVEN that the user has a digipet with all stats at the maximum (100), 
WHEN they send a GET request to the /digipet/hatchnew endpoint, THEN the server responds with a message 
confirming that they have looked after their first digipet well and have proven that they can have another one.
It also includes digipet stats for both the first digipet and the second digipet

3.GIVEN that the user has a digipet with some stats below 100, 
WHEN they send a GET request to the /digipet/hatchnew endpoint, 
THEN the server responds with a message letting the user know that they must prove that they can look after their digipet well enough to get a new one.
They are prompted to feed, walk and train the dog until all stats get to 100.
Includes current digipet stats.
